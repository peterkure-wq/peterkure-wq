## Hi there 👋

I'm **Peter**, a **Senior Product Manager** working in the **AI / ML space**.

I'm currently learning and experimenting with:
- 🌱 **Python** (for data science and automation)
- 🌱 **Git & GitHub / GitLab**
- 🌱 **Machine Learning models**
- 🌱 **AI agents and workflows**
- 🌱 **CI/CD fundamentals**

This GitHub profile is a **learning space** where I:
- Share small experiments and prototypes
- Practice version control and CI/CD
- Explore how models and agents move from idea → code → automation

Right now, I'm focused on **building fundamentals** and learning in public.

📫 More coming soon.
